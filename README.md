# PitchPerfect

This is the first project submission for the [Udacity](https://udacity.com) iOS Nanodegree.

I learned how to use:

* `UINavigationController` to allow the user to navigate back to a previous screen
* `Segue` in code with `performSegueWithIdentifier`
* `@IBAction` and `@IBOutlet` to wire together the UI to the code
* I had to use the delegate pattern while implementing `audioRecorderDidFinishRecording` to handle audio recordings and playing audio
